Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction; reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.\n",

    "  `3`  |   Average   | Some evidence of deferred maintenance and normal obsolescence with age in that a few minor repairs are needed, along with some refinishing. All major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy. Effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.\n",

    "   `9`   | Better architectural design with extra interior and exterior design and quality.\n",
    "  `10`   | Homes of this quality generally have high quality features. Finish work is better and more design quality is seen in the floor plans. Generally have a larger square footage.\n",
    "  `11`   | Custom design and higher quality finish work with added amenities of solid woods, bathroom fixtures and more luxurious options.\n",
